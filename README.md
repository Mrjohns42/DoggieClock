# DoggieClock
In the style of a "Days since last accident..." factory safety sign, Doggie Clock tracks the time since my new puppy's last accident.

Or you can modify the code and track the passage of time for any event you desire.

My motivaiton for this project was mainly to experiment with tri-color EINK displays and an ESP32, and hopefully make something fun and useful from them.
